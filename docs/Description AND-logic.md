Diagram (rewritten for clarity):

     5V
      |
    [10kΩ] Pull-up
      |
      +-------+--------> V_out
      |       |
     [>]     [>]       (diodes: anode at 5V, cathode toward button)
      |       |
   Button1  Button2
      |       |
     GND     GND

Buttons grounded: when pressed, they pull the cathode of the diode to GND, causing current to flow → V_out gets pulled LOW.

When both buttons are not pressed, both diodes are reverse-biased (actually the buttons make the circuit to be open, like if they were reverse biased)→ no current → pull-up pulls V_out HIGH.

It behaves like a diode AND gate:

Only when both buttons are not pressed, V_out = HIGH

Pressing either button → pulls V_out LOW

✔️ Works exactly like an AND gate (in active-low logic).

🧠 Logic Truth Table:
Button1|Button2|V_out|Logic Interpretation
Not pressed|Not pressed|HIGH|Logic 1 AND 1 → 1|
Pressed|Not pressed|LOW|Logic 0 AND 1 → 0|
Not pressed|Pressed|LOW|Logic 1 AND 0 → 0|
Pressed|Pressed|LOW|Logic 0 AND 0 → 0|

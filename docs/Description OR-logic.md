The buttons are normally open and connected to +5 V.

The diodes’ anodes are connected to the buttons; cathodes are tied together at V_out.

A 10 kΩ pull-down resistor from V_out to GND defines the LOW state when no button is pressed.

🧠 Logic Behavior
When no button is pressed, both diodes are reverse-biased → the pull-down keeps V_out LOW.

If either button is pressed, the corresponding diode becomes forward-biased and sources current into V_out → V_out rises HIGH.

If both buttons are pressed, both diodes conduct, and V_out is still HIGH.

This behaves like a diode OR gate in active-high logic:

Logic “1” = button pressed

Logic “0” = button not pressed

| Button1      | Button2      | V_out | Logic Interpretation |
|--------------|--------------|-------|----------------------|
| Not pressed  | Not pressed  | LOW   | 0 OR 0 → 0           |
| Pressed      | Not pressed  | HIGH  | 1 OR 0 → 1           |
| Not pressed  | Pressed      | HIGH  | 0 OR 1 → 1           |
| Pressed      | Pressed      | HIGH  | 1 OR 1 → 1           |
